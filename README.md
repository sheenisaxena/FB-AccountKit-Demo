# FB-AccountKit-Demo
Newly launched facebook accountkit for login. 

This demo is about account kit given by facebook for login authentication and security. There are two ways authorization can be done using graph API : Access Token FLow & Auth Code Flow.

I have learnt and understand this course from udacity and add comments on every line of code for error faced & code done.
User can get more details from udacity free courses also if want.

I hope this will help others.

Happy Coding!
